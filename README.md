# Pokemon: Type Battles (rock, paper, scissors)

This is a unique take on the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors", using the classic Pokemon types: Grass, Fire, and Water.

## How to play?

You are given three options to choose from: **Grass, Fire,** and **Water.**

**Each type has an advantage** over each other as shown below.

* **Grass** > _Water_
* **Fire** > _Grass_
* **Water** > _Fire_

Your goal is to **beat the Computer Trainers chosen type with the type of your own** but neither of you know what type you chose until you both picked a type.

The Trainer with the **most wins in 6 moves** wins the game!

*If both Trainers choose the same type, it will result in a tie which will not grant a score for either Trainer.*
